The `samples' subdirectory contains some examples of using libconfig
from C and C++.


Notes on version 0.9:

In order to implement all of the feature/enhancement requests in an
elegant and self-consistent way, the configuration grammar had to be
changed in a non-backward-compatible way. In particular, groups are
now values, so the old syntax:

group
{
   ...
}

must now be written as:

group =
{
   ...
};

Note that the trailing semicolon, which was previously optional, is
now required. Also note that a colon (':') can be used in place of the
equals sign.


The next release of libconfig will be version 1.0, and will not
include any further feature enhancements; it will be a maintenance
release to address any bugs discovered in version 0.9.
