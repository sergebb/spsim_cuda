2006-07-29  Mark Lindner  <markl@neuromancer>

	* <multiple> - major grammar redesign: groups are now values instead of
	  distinct syntax constructs; this allows groups to be elements of
	  lists
	* libconfig.texi - documentation updates; added new chapter containing
	  the BNF grammar
	* test.cfg - modified to reflect new syntax and to demonstrate lists

2006-06-23  Mark Lindner  <markl@neuromancer>

	* <multiple> - added support for lists (collections of
	  heterogeneous values of any type)
	* libconfig.c - pretty-printing fixes in config_write()

2006-06-08  Mark Lindner  <markl@neuromancer>

	* libconfig.h++ - added private copy constructor & assignment operator
	  (from Josef Meile)
	* ligconfigcpp.c++, libconfig.h++ - added cast operators for unsigned
	  int and unsigned long (from Scott Frazer)
	* <multiple> - add support for value formats; the only non-default
	  format currently supported is hexadecimal format for integer values
	  (based on patch from Scott Frazer)

2006-04-15  Mark Lindner  <markl@neuromancer>

	* <multiple> - added pkg-config support

2006-03-31  mlindner  <markl@neuromancer>

	* <multiple> - cleaned up config.tab.h mess (this file was obsolete,
	  and superseded by grammar.h ... problem identified by Scott Frazer)

2006-03-30  mlindner  <mlindner@chimera>

	* grammar.y - fixed includes for windows (missing decl of malloc/free)
	* libconfig.c - fixed several signed/unsigned warnings
	* doc/libconfig.texi - documentation updates, formatting fix
	* scanner.l - allow lowercase 'true' and 'false' in addition to
	  'TRUE' and 'FALSE'

2006-03-27  Mark Lindner  <markl@neuromancer>

	* libconfigcpp.c++ - added missing break statements in switch (from
	  Lukas Zweifel)
	* libconfig.c - don't strdup() a NULL string (from Lukas Zweifel)
	* grammar.c, grammar.h - regenerated with bison 2.1

2006-03-20  Mark Lindner  <markl@neuromancer>

	* scanner.l - added '%option nounistd' and regenerated with newest
	  version of flex; Windows doesn't have unistd.h.

2006-03-17  Mark Lindner  <markl@neuromancer>

	* grammar.y - bugfix; error & abort parsing if duplicate setting name
	  encountered (previously caused a crash ... reported by Tobias Witek)
	* scanner.l - bugfix; multi-line C-style comments were causing line
	  number counting to be thrown off, because the newlines were being
	  "eaten"
	* <multiple> - various fixes to support building of DLLs on Windows.

2005-11-26  Mark Lindner  <markl@neuromancer>

	* grammar.y, scanner.l - always strdup() yytext, and free the memory
	  in the grammar rules.

2005-11-22  Mark Lindner  <markl@neuromancer>

	* libconfigcpp.c++, libconfig.h++, libconfig.c, libconfig.h -
	  Added Daniel's enhancements: methods & functions for reading/writing
	  files, fixes for various memory leaks, etc.
	* samples/* - Added Daniel's example code.
	* docs/libconfig.texi - Updated documentation

2005-09-28  Mark Lindner  <markl@neuromancer>

	* libconfigcpp.c++, libconfig.h++, libconfig.c, libconfig.h
	  Enhanced API to support modification of a configuration.
	* libconfig.texi - updated manual

2005-06-02  Mark Lindner  <markl@neuromancer>

	* libconfigcpp.c++, libconfig.h++ - Added getName() method;
	  fixed operator[](int) to work with groups; this allows iteration over
	  a group's child settings. Added a missing break statement (bugfix
	  submitted by Pablo Barrera Gonzalez). Added operator int() and
	  operator float() to Setting; note that these may cause loss of
	  precision since the actual values are stored internally as long
	  and double, respectively.

	* libconfig.h - added config_setting_name() macro

	* libconfig.c - maintain two lists of children at each node; a sorted
	  list and an unsorted list (to preserve the order of the settings as
	  they appear in the file).
	
	* scanner.l - fixed scanner rule for comments. '#' no longer has to
	  be in column 0 to be recognized as a comment. Added support for C
	  and C++ style comments.
